# Python OS - The UI Project

The UI Project. A project to make a basic OS running on the Python Interpreter. The correct file to run is main.py and the file.txt is necessary for the openfile() function so that it has a file to open, however if you make a new file under a different name, use this file, or rename this file, the code will read off of it. Just verify that after it asks for the file to be inputted you specify the correct file name including the .txt at the end.
